# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing high school students' academic performance using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to identify significant predictors of academic success and build predictive models based on demographic, socioeconomic, and personal factors.

# Key Features

## Data Analysis

* Imported data from CSV files into R Studio for analysis.

* Conducted statistical analyses using:

  * __ANOVA__ to compare means and understand group differences.

  * __Hypothesis Testing__ models to identify significant predictors of academic performance.

## Machine Learning Models

Developed and tested various machine learning models to predict student outcomes:

* __Logistic Regression__: For binary classification of academic outcomes.

* __Random Forests__: To handle non-linear relationships and rank feature importance.

* __Neural Networks__: For capturing complex patterns in the data.

## Tools and Technologies

* __R Studio__: For data analysis and statistical modeling.

* __Machine Learning Algorithms__: Implemented using R packages.

* __CSV Files__: Used as the primary data source for importing student data.

## Methodology

__1. Data Preprocessing:__

* Cleaned and structured the data for analysis.

* Handled missing values and normalized data where necessary.

__2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__

* Visualized trends and relationships in the data.

* Identified potential predictors of academic performance.

__3. Statistical Analysis:__

* Applied ANOVA and hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.

__4. Model Development:__

* Built machine learning models with a focus on accuracy and interpretability.

* Evaluated model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
